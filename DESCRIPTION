<b>Description</b>
Birthday Adapter provides birthdays, anniversaries, and other events from your contacts as a real calendar, which is displayed in your standard Android calendar application.
To my knowledge, this is the first implementation that implements birthdays as a real calendar integrated in the Android calendar.
All other apps only displays their own lists but have no real integration!

<b>Known bugs</b>

• Reminder do not work correctly on Android 2.3

<b>Features</b>
• Total integration of birthdays, anniversaries, and other events as a calendar
• Color picker for this birthday calendar
• Default reminder can be set in-app
• Filter contact events based on account
