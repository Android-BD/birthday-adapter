<b>Description</b>
Birthday Adapter provides birthdays, anniversaries, and other events from your contacts as a real calendar, which is displayed in your standard Android calendar application.
To my knowledge, this is the first implementation that implements birthdays as a calendar displayed in Android's Calendar app.
All other apps only displays their own lists but have no real integration!

<b>Known bugs</b>
• Reminder do not work correctly on Android 2.3
• <b>Devices with Android 4.1 and all version of Samsung Galaxy S4</b> have a bug which causes Birthday Adapter to disable after reboots. Please install additionally:
